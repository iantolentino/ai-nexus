# AI Nexus — AI Project Control System

AI Nexus is a **state-driven control framework** for AI-assisted software development.

It does not contain application code. It contains the **governance system that tells an AI how to plan, structure, and build a project** — enforcing deterministic behavior, preventing runaway token usage, and guaranteeing complete outputs.

---

## Why This Exists

Most AI-assisted projects break down because:

- The AI makes assumptions about requirements
- Planning and coding get mixed in the same session
- Context bloat causes the AI to lose track of prior decisions
- Outputs are partial, inconsistent, or unrepeatable

AI Nexus fixes this with a strict **4-state execution model** and a memory system that keeps context minimal and controlled.

---

## How It Works

All AI behavior is governed by `_brain/claude.md` (the brain controller).

The AI moves through four states in order. No state can be skipped.

| State | Name | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | BOOTSTRAP_MODE | AI collects project specs. No files written. No code. |
| 2 | CONFIRMATION_LOCK | AI presents plan. Waits for your approval. |
| 3 | SYSTEM_GENERATION | AI writes the full `_brain/` structure. No code yet. |
| 4 | EXECUTION_MODE | AI executes one task at a time. Updates memory. Stops. |

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1 — Add AI Nexus to your project

Open a terminal in your project's root folder and run whichever fits your platform:

```bash
# Mac / Linux / WSL / Git Bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iantolentino/ai-nexus/main/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell (or pwsh on Mac/Linux)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iantolentino/ai-nexus/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bat
:: Windows cmd.exe — download setup.bat into your project root first, then:
setup.bat
```

All three do the same thing and are safe to re-run any time:

> 1. Clone the AI Nexus repository into a temp folder
> 2. If `_brain/` doesn't exist yet → install it fresh
> 3. If `_brain/` already exists → update framework files only (`claude.md`, `prompts/`,
>    `governance/`, etc.) and **never touch your project data** (`memory/`, `progress/`,
>    `fixes/fix_log.md`, `decisions/`, ...) — see `_brain/templates/update_rules.md`
> 4. Drop root-level pointer files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`,
>    `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — only where none already exist — so that **whichever AI
>    tool you use, it auto-loads instructions to read `_brain/claude.md` first**, before scanning
>    anything else. This is the main token-saving mechanism: one small file read up front instead
>    of a full repo scan every session.
> 5. Clean up and confirm completion

---

### Step 2 — Start a new project with AI

Open a new AI chat session (Claude, ChatGPT, or any LLM).

Copy and paste the contents of `_brain/prompts/bootstrap_prompt.md` into the chat.

The AI will enter BOOTSTRAP_MODE and ask you 8 questions about your project. Answer them.

---

### Step 3 — Review and approve the plan

After you answer the questions, the AI moves to CONFIRMATION_LOCK.

It will present:
- A feature classification (what to build now, defer, or reject)
- A dependency map
- A high-level architecture

Reply with **confirm**, **approved**, or **proceed** to continue.

The AI will then generate the full `_brain/` planning structure for your project (SYSTEM_GENERATION).

---

### Step 4 — Build, one task at a time

For every new session where you want to continue building:

Copy and paste the contents of `_brain/prompts/continue_prompt.md` into a new chat.

The AI will:
1. Read `_brain/progress/progress.md` and `_brain/summaries/current_state.md`
2. Select the next incomplete task
3. Execute it fully
4. Update the memory files
5. Stop

Repeat this for each session.

---

### Debugging

If something breaks, copy and paste the contents of `_brain/prompts/debug_prompt.md` into a chat, then describe the problem.

The AI will first check `_brain/fixes/fix_log.md` for a matching prior fix — if this exact bug (or
one like it) was already solved in a past session, the AI reuses that root cause instead of
re-diagnosing from scratch. Then it fixes only what is broken — no refactoring, no feature
additions — and logs the fix back to `fixes/fix_log.md` before stopping, so the next session (or
the next AI tool entirely) doesn't repeat the investigation.

```

At your project root, the installer also places (only where none already exists):
`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` —
each just a pointer telling whatever AI tool auto-loads it to read `_brain/claude.md` first.

## Token Efficiency

AI Nexus is designed to keep context small and predictable.

| Metric | Uncontrolled AI | With AI Nexus |
|---|---|---|
| Files read per session | All (full repo scan) | 2–3 files max |
| Tasks per session | Multiple (unbounded) | Exactly one |
| Token usage (medium project) | ~250,000 | ~90,000 |
| Reduction | — | ~55–65% |

---

## Rules

- `claude.md` is the only file that controls AI behavior — never modify it during a project
- Every AI tool must read `claude.md` in full before touching anything else — that's what the
  root-level `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` / `.windsurfrules` /
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` pointer files enforce
- All other `_brain/` files are data — the AI reads and writes them, you can read them anytime
- Never skip a state
- Never ask the AI to execute multiple tasks in one session
- Never fix a bug without checking `fixes/fix_log.md` first, and never finish one without logging it
- If something is unclear, consult `interaction/assumptions.md` — the AI is required to ask rather than guess

---

## Who This Is For

- Developers building serious AI-assisted projects
- Anyone hitting token limits or losing context across sessions
- Teams who need predictable, repeatable AI outputs
- Long-running or multi-phase builds where consistency matters
